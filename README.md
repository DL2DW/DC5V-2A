# DC5V-2A

Sorry for the bad shot, but this thing is too small for my phone camera. :-) 



## DC converter for 5V in TO-3 format

This project came about for two reasons. Firstly, I had dealt with the topic of DC converters and Ripple in general. 

So it was a learning project for me among other things. This model was preceded by some prototypes to achieve an optimal result.

I had set myself the following goals:

- Easy to solder
- As compact as possible
- Avoidance of multilayers
- Low ripple
- Low temperature development under full load
- Inexpensive

The second reason why this project came about: I needed a DC converter that could output 5V (and one with 12V) and 2A. This was needed for another project. 

Of course, I could have bought a ready-made module. But hey, where is the fun and the learning effect? :-)



# Trivia

There was never actually a TO-3 module planned. That had somehow come about in the course of the project. I had already built an extended replica of a Commodore 1541 board. And the linear regulators disturbed me immensely. Not only do they get too hot, they are also hard to get.

By the way, if you have a problem with switching regulators on a Commodore disk drive, at least of the VC1541 series, I recommend to measure the ripple on a living object (the original version with switching regulator) :-)



# Technical

A switching regulator from Texas Instruments in the form of the TPS54332DDAR was used. On the one hand, this is exactly what I needed in terms of data, it is inexpensive and easy to install.

I designed the converter to handle 5V with a continuous load of 2A. At continuous load, it gets a good 50 degrees warm after 2 hours without an additional heat sink. Whereas the outside temperature during the measurement was about 30 degrees.

I have chosen two solderable bolts with internal thread for mounting. If the converter is fixed on a board with a correspondingly large copper surface via these bolts, then the temperature goes down to 38 degrees, at continuous load over several hours.

I could not measure any temperature increase in the nominal range of 1A, where the outside temperature was 30 degrees. 

The DC Converter can easily replace, for example, the well-known 7805 in TO-3 format, but still has enough reserve.

I once created a 3D image, because I unfortunately could not get sharp photos.

# BOM

Here is the parts list for the DC converter. Of course you don't have to use exactly these brands. However, I give to note that comparison types, especially if they have a somewhat poorer quality, can have a negative effect on the ripple.

If you liked my project, I would be very happy about a small coffee donation.
